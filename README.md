> **A comprehensive guide and implementation reference for building intelligent, autonomous AI systems.**

## 📖 Overview
This repository serves as a hands-on guide to **Agentic Design Patterns**, providing both the theoretical framework and practical code implementations for building robust AI agents. It covers everything from foundational prompt chaining to advanced multi-agent orchestration.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- **`Agentic_Design_Patterns.pdf`** - The complete 400+ page guidebook and theoretical reference.
- **`notebooks/`** - Executable Jupyter notebooks implementing the patterns.

## 📚 Pattern Catalog

### Part 1: Core Foundations
| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Prompt Chaining** | Decomposing complex tasks into sequential steps. |
| **Routing** | Directing queries to the most appropriate model or path. |
| **Parallelization** | Running independent tasks concurrently for speed. |
| **Reflection** | Mechanisms for agents to critique and improve their own output. |
| **Tool Use** | Integration with external APIs, databases, and environments. |

### Part 2: Agent Capabilities
* **Memory Management:** Short-term, long-term, and episodic memory implementation.
* **Learning & Adaptation:** Systems that improve performance over time.
* **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Standardizing context for large-scale operations.

### Part 3: Advanced Orchestration
* **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Coordination between specialized agents.
* **Planning:** Strategic task decomposition (ReAct, Plan-and-Solve).
* **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** Connecting agents to external knowledge bases.
